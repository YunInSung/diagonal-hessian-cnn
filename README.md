## Modified Custom Optimizer (RMSProp variant)

This repository builds on the original MLP implementation from [relu‑based‑2ndOrder‑convergence](https://github.com/YunInSung/relu-based-2ndOrder-convergence) in two ways:

1. **MLP**: directly forked and patched the original code to incorporate the changes below.  
2. **CNN**: provided a new `tf.keras.Model` subclass (`MyModel`) that embeds the same optimizer logic for convolutional architectures.

All changes applied uniformly to both variants:

- **Removed Hessian‑based dynamic learning rate computed from batch loss** now using a fixed learning rate 
- **Applied standard RMSProp gradient scaling**   
- Hyperparameters adjusted to:
  - `diff = 0.3`
  - `square = 5`
  - **Learning rate** fixed in the range **7.5e‑5 – 1e‑4**
- **Performance**: Even on a simple MLP architecture, this configuration consistently outperforms the original optimizer across training loss and convergence speed.
